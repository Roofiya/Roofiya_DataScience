Project 1: CUSTOMER CHURN IN TELECOM PREDICTION: Project Overview

Telecommunication industry always suffers from very high churn rates, when one industry offers a better plan than the previous there is a high possibility of the customer churning from the present due to a better plan. In such a scenario it is very difficult to avoid losses but through prediction we can keep it to a minimal level. The key focus of market players therefore is on retention of the existing customers and churn control.

This project summarizes all the primary statistical modelling and analysis results associated with analysing factors which influence Customer Churn in the district of Columbia. Data were collected from 4000 randomly selected people and each personâ€™s response recorded. This project explores the churn dataset to identify the key drivers of churn and builds the best predictive model to predict churn. 

The test set is evaluated against the best model and strategies to reduce churn is presented. This is a binary classification problem and there are only 2 possible outcomes for each observations.
